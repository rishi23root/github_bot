# github_bot 😎
This bot is for simplyfy the process of creating and updaing github repository 

## first place github_bot.py in the default directory of python to use it from any directory 🤠
I place it in `C:\Python38` folder 

# by simple two commends 🤯
 - To create a folder on pc and repository on github of Project name
```
python -m github_bot start_project <project name>
```

 -To update the repository after saving the file and complete the work
```
python -m github_bot update_project <project name>
```
